- [500 Scorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.antsapps.tennotrumps)
  - If you play the card game [500](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/500_(card_game)>), this app is perfect for scoring.
- [AZ Screen Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free)
  - The best screen recording app I've found so far.
- [Backdrops](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.backdrops.wallpapers)
  - Great app for wallpapers. Allows you to favorite and set wallpapers right in the app.
- [Be My Eyes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bemyeyes.bemyeyes)
  - App that allows sighted people volunteer to help blind or visually impaired people with any tasks that they need help with. It's saturated with volunteers, so you won't get very many calls. I've had it installed for about two years, and have only had one: she needed help identifying a couple spices in her cabinet.
- [Bitwarden](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.x8bit.bitwarden)
  - My favorite password manager. More info on their [website](https://bitwarden.com/).
- [Budget Bytes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sidechef.sidechef.partner.budgetbytes)
  - Great app for recipes. More info on their [website](https://www.budgetbytes.com/).
- [Calcy IV](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tesmath.calcy)
  - If you play [Pokemon Go](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticlabs.pokemongo), this app is essential. Tells you the IVs and overall rating of your pokemon, and lets you rename them accordingly. Since it uses information from your screen and doesn't actively interact with the Pokemon Go application, it doesn't break TOS.
- [Calendar](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.calendar)
  - Still the best calendar app.
- [Car Expenses](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kb2.soft.carexpenses)
  - I've been using this app for a couple years now. Keeps track of fuel fillups and any other car expenses you want to keep track of. The only bad thing about it is that the export file isn't easy to parse on your own.
- [CPlus for Craigslist](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yanflex.craigslist)
  - The best Craigslist app I've found so far.
- [Daylio](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.daylio)
  - Daily mood/journal tracker. I've been using it for a year or so now and I love it.
- [Early Bird Alarm](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.funanduseful.earlybirdalarm)
  - The alarm app I've been using for at least a couple years. No problems with it at all.
- [Google Opinion Rewards](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.paidtasks)
  - Sends you occasional surveys. When you complete them, you get Google Play money.
- [Hue Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.benchevoor.huepro)
  - Great third-part Philips Hue app.
- [Libra](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.cachapa.libra)
  - By far the best app for keeping track of your weight. Comparable to Happy Scale for iOS.
- [List My Apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.onyxbits.listmyapps)
  - The app I used to generate this list. Creates a list of the apps you have installed and lets you export it in different formats.
- [NordVPN](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nordvpn.android)
  - My favorite VPN. Learn more at their [website](https://nordvpn.com/).
- [Nova Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher)
  - The launcher I've been using since around 2014. Fantastic and very customizable. [Nova Launcher Prime](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher.prime) is worth every penny.
- [Google Photos](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.photos)
  - App version of [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com/).
- [Relay Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=reddit.news)
  - The best [Reddit](https://reddit.com) client on Android. Buying the pro version is worth the money.
- [Splitwise](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Splitwise.SplitwiseMobile)
  - Easy to use app for keeping track of who owes you money, or to whom you owe money.
- [SwiftKey Keyboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.touchtype.swiftkey)
  - The best keyboard on Android.
- [Textra](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.textra)
  - My favorite texting application on Android. Customizable and fast.
- [Venmo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.venmo)
  - App for instantly sending money to people.
