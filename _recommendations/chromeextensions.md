# Browser Extensions

In no particular order...

## uBlock Origin [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm) | [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)

When I encounter a new web browser, whether it's from a fresh install or for whatever other reason, this is the first extension I go for. It's a fantastic ad blocker that lets you use custom block lists that others have created. 

## Google Dictionary [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-dictionary-by-goog/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja)

Allows you to double-click on a word and see the definition in a little popup balloon. Real nifty. I find myself using it all the time.

Unfortunately, there isn't a Firefox version of this extension. However, there is something similar: [English Popup Dictionary](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/english-popup-dictionary/).

## Bitwarden [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bitwarden-free-password-m/nngceckbapebfimnlniiiahkandclblb) | [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/)

My password manager of choice. I've tried others (LastPass and 1Password, primarily) and Bitwarden is by far the most consistent with syncing and mobile use. I've been using it for about 3 years without any issues.

## WhatRuns [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatruns/cmkdbmfndkfgebldhnkbfhlneefdaaip) | [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/whatruns/)

Lets you see the technology that's running the website that you're on.

## EditThisCookie [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg)

Similar addon for Firefox: [Cookie Quick Manager](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-quick-manager/).

## Lighthouse [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk)

Similar addon for Firefox (I have *not* tested this!) [Lighthouse Report Generator](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lighthouse-report-generator/)

## ShareX [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sharex/nlkoigbdolhchiicbonbihbphgamnaoc) | [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sharex/)

In conjunction with the ShareX [Windows application](https://getsharex.com/), this is by far the best way to take screenshots and videos on your computer.

## HTTPS Everywhere [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/https-everywhere/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp) | [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/https-everywhere/)

Forces HTTPS by default on all sites you visit.
