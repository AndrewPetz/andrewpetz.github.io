# Thoughts

A couple days ago, I saw this [post](https://ryanandrewlangdon.wordpress.com/2020/01/28/today-i-learned-that-not-everyone-has-an-internal-monologue-and-it-has-ruined-my-day/) on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22193451) and it's had me thinking about... well, how I think. Reading the comments has been absolutely fascinating, as people discuss how they think as well, primarily in the context of internal monologues vs. abstract thoughts.

I immediately realized that, while I had never actually *thought* about it before, I fall into the "abstract thoughts" category. As I go about my day, I almost never think in full sentences. Rather, I think about things in terms of abstract concepts and/or feelings.

I've been talking with friends and coworkers about this phenomenon, and I've made some potentially interesting observations.
