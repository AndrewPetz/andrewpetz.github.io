Almost exactly three years ago, I started my first woodburning project, a gift for some good friends of mine who were soon going to be visiting for a weekend. Behold, in all its glory, the initial pencil outline.

Using the glorified soldering iron that I bought on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005P1TRAS), I fumbled my way through my first burn, producing this masterpiece:

The effort was there, but the execution was... lacking, to say the least. I didn't have the equipment, the artistic ability, or the know-how to make a good-quality woodburn. I don't think I ever quite got there, but I did improve quite a bit. Over time, I managed to improve quite a bit, though I never quite got to where I wanted to be. I got pretty ambitious with it, even setting up an Etsy shop and trying to sell some burns at my parents' spring garage sale. All that effort led to one commission, which I'm pretty proud of to this day:

See the texture, the uneven shading? I was pressing hard enough into the wood to score it. I never quite got good at not doing that (say that five times fast) but eventually it got at least somewhat better.
