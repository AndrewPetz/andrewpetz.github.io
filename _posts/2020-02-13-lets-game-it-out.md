For the first of what I hope will be many posts about things I like, I want to highlight a YouTube channel I've been pretty obsessed with lately. It's called [Let's Game It Out](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCto7D1L-MiRoOziCXK9uT5Q).

It's probably best described by Josh, the creator: "A gaming let's play channel by some guy named Josh who makes fun-loving videos filled with joy and sarcasm." That... pretty much sums it up. But if you dig deeper, this channel is the story of a man so depraved, so... inhuman, that his lust for violence and love of torture cannot be contained within his imagination alone. Instead, he must take it out on the innocent video games he so methodically rips apart, like the delicate wings of a housefly being torn off by a disturbed toddler.

In case that's not a clear enough description, Josh likes to take games in his grubby little sausage fingers and twist and turn them until something hilarious pops out. He's a fantastic narrator to the cosmic-level horrors he inflicts upon his virtual victims, and leaves me belly-laughing in my chair every time I watch. His latest video, a masterclass of wickedness and brilliance the likes of which I've never seen before, is the perfect introduction: [I Built a Theme Park of Perpetual Torment in Planet Coaster](https://youtu.be/BvEKky9N1tQ). Enjoy. I know I did.
