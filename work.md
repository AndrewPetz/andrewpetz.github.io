# Professional History

I graduated from the [University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire](https://uwec.edu) in May of 2016 with a B.S. in Computer Science. During my college career, I had internships with [Menards](https://www.menards.com/main/home.html) in Eau Claire, WI and [Ashley Furniture](https://www.ashleyfurnitureindustriesinc.com/) in Arcadia, WI. After graduation, I started working full-time as a developer for Ashley Furniture on the same team with which I had the internship. In December of 2018, I accepted a new position as a .NET Software Engineer for the [University of Wisconsin - Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), which is where I currently work.

# Misc. History

In the fall of 2016, I started coaching middle school football in Arcadia. I coached for three seasons before moving to Madison, and I loved every minute of it.

In the fall of 2017, I was asked to consider becoming a mentor for the brand-new robotics team in the area, [Trempealeau County Robotics](https://www.tcrobotics.tech/) ([TBA link](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/7021)). We had an amazing rookie season in 2018, and although I'm no longer able to be a mentor, I wish them all the best.
