## Project management and todos

### [Todoist](https://todoist.com/r/andrew_petz_wkyjxq) ([non-referral link](https://todoist.com))

As far as todo apps go, Todoist has been my favorite so far. The best part about it is the smart due date detection - I can type something like `Do laundry tom at 6pm` and Todoist understands that it's due tomorrow at 6pm. Also works for repeating tasks: `Pay electric bill at 8am on the 15th of every month` works just as well. It's really a fantastic system, and every time I try a different app, I come back to Todoist.

### [Trello](https://trello.com/andrewpetz/recommend) ([non-referral link](https://trello.com))

Trello is less of a specific todos app and more a project planning app. At its core, Trello is a [kanban board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) app. This flexibility allows you to use it in any configuration you want. I have boards for things like movies/TV shows to watch, books to read, keeping track of classes/homework, and personal projects.
